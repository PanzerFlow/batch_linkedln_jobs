The goal of this project is to build a data pipeline to **extract and transform canadian data engineering job postings from Linkedin**. 
The final output of this project is an interactive PowerBI dashboard, which provides an overview of trends in canadian data engineering job market. 
The motivation of the project was based on an interest in understanding various trends in the data engineering jobs market and how they evolve. 

This project also provides a good opportunity to develop skills and experience in a range of tools. 
As such, the project is more complex than required, utilising airflow, docker and a series of aws technology (S3,EC2,Glue,Atehna,lambda).

Componets
- Data Publisher
  - The architecture of this project is designed to be event driven. Pipeline will be triggered once data is arrives in S3.
  - Currently the data source is a cron job that triggers a shell script which then starts a linkedin scraper written in python. 

- Cloud Storage
  - A dedicated S3 bucket is used as the cloud storage. There are 3 different folder in this bucket that serves different puporses. 
  - /raw is where the raw data will land in. Any put request in this folder will start an event notification to lambda function
  - /stg is where the proccessed data live.
  - /scripts is where the pyspark sript located. There are also automated github action setup which uploads the script to this location after each git push. 

- Orchestration
  - Airflow is used as the orchestration tool to scheudle emr and glue activity.
  - Airflow is set up using the EC2 instance and docker-compose.
  - S3 event notification and lambda funciton is used to trigger airflow dag via REST API.

- Compute resources
  - EC2 is used to host the data publisher and airflow. The data publisher can be moved in the future.
  - EMR is used to transform the data once it arrives in /raw.
  - Glue crawler and Athena are used as the compute engine which powers the dashboard. 

- Visuliaztion
  - PowerBI is used for dashboarding
